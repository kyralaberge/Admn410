	<h2>History:</h2>
	The Smiths opened the doors to Durham House of Pets in 1899. Located on Main St
	Durham, New Hampshire, founder Herald Smith saw a need for a pet supply store in the 
	community after his family adopted a sweet elderly golden retriever named Lucy. The 
	shelves were stocked with many different brands of food and toys.<p>The Durham House 
	of Pets was a one stop shop for everyoneâ€™s pet supply needs.
	Herald and wife Cindy then decided to replicate the success of their first store by
	opening their second location in Manchester. Over the years, some of the products offered 
	have changed but one thing stays the same across all locations, a warm welcome and a caring
	 staff to help you with all your pet supply needs.
